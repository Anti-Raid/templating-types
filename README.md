AntiRaid templating types

Discord typings here are provided by https://github.com/thegalaxydev/Aloha and as such may may be *newer* than AntiRaids.

- ``@antiraid`` - AntiRaid core types
- ``@antiraid-ext`` - Extra helper functions and library functions to make development easier. **Note that these functions are not part of AntiRaid and must be bundled in using ``darklua`` etc**
